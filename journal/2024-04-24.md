## Modify the dockerfiles
Since I always failed as attempting building an image by the dockerfiles I create, I try to modify it. 
Solution: 
Add the option [-y] of `yum` into the dockerfiles. 

However it still crash, therefore I modify the dockerfile and split the installing libraries, the `curl -O` and untaring CASA into 3 layers. 

I can finally build the image sucessfully.
