## Using CASA table tool read the visibility
```CASA
tb.open(visibility)
tb.getcol("")
```
The rubrics we can read from the visibility:
1. **DATA**: The measured complex visibilities (amplitude and phase) for each baseline and spectral channel.
2. **UVW**
3. **TIME**
4. **ANTENA1, ANTENA2**
5. **FIELD_ID**
6. **FLAG**
7. **WEIGHT**
8. **SIGMA**
8. **ARRAY_ID**
8. **CORRECTED_DATA**
8. **MODEL_DATA**
8. **INTERVAL**

I have figure out the method to read information for visibility by CASA.  
But I still have problems to do the fitting. Such as the method derive the stokes by the sort of the field.  
I might can try the below:
```python
field_id = [0, 18, 25, 94, 101, 133, 134]	# Known the field id I want
ms.open(filename)
for id in field_id:
    ms.select({'field_id':id})
    d = ms.getdata(['data', 'time', 'weight'])
	...
	...
    # Then derive XX, YY and I stokes
	...
	...
ms.close()
```
