## reset the procedure of creating docker images and container
After we have setup all the libraries we need, we can do following steps.
1. Commit container into images
```bash
docker commit [contianer_id] [repository[:tag]]
```
2. Save the image into tarball
```bash
docker image save -o [filename].tar [repository[:tag]]
```
Then on other local,
```bash
docker load --input [filename].tar		# imoport file into imags
docker run -ti [repository[:tag]]
```
