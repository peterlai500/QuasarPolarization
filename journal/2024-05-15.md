Finish the entire sequence for now, the fitting function seems works.  
However there still bugs existing. If the data is observed in mosaic (source is not in the center of field), the `uvmodelfit` cannot fit the Stokes I well.

- Still need to fix the bug by modifying the Stokes I directly derive from the visibility and fitting it to UV distance.
