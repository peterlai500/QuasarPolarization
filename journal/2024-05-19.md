## bug on dealing data
Error message:
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate 25.0 TiB for an array with shape (1816080, 1, 1895040) and data type float64

Explain the error message for me. I occur this when I attempting to toss out the autocorrelation placeholders for XX and YY

The error is been indicated at the section for "tossing out autocorrelation placeholders".  
### Toss out autocorrelation placeholders
By ChatGPT-3.5:  
> When calculating flux amplitude, tossing out autocorrelation placeholders is done to mitigate the effects of any inherent periodicity or correlation within the data that is not related to the variability of the source itself. This is particularly important when analyzing periodic or quasi-periodic signals, where the autocorrelation structure may introduce biases in the estimation of flux amplitude.
> By removing autocorrelation placeholders, you essentially remove any spurious correlations that might inflate or distort the estimation of flux amplitude, allowing for a more accurate characterization of the true variability of the source. This is crucial for understanding the underlying physical processes driving the variability and making meaningful interpretations about the nature of the astronomical object being studied.
