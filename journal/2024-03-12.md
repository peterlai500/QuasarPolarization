## install libraries for CASA-5.6.1 on CentOS-7.2009 container
- Attempt to fix the error. 
Error message: 
```
failed to load casa:
No module named _atmosphere
```
Solution:
- The Github issue I found mentioned that group install the development tool
Trial:
```bash
yum groupinstall "development tool"
```
